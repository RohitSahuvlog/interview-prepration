// In ‘Raining Trivia,’ a real-time trivia game, I worked on the backend using Node.js. My main job was to manage the server-side logic to ensure smooth gameplay. The server handled all game logic, managed user sessions, and enabled real-time communication between players and the server for a responsive experience.

// I built the server using Node.js, Express, and SQL. Node.js's non-blocking nature was great for handling many connections at once. Express helped manage routing and APIs, and SQL managed relational data like user profiles, game sessions, and leaderboard stats. This setup allowed efficient data handling and quick retrieval, ensuring the game could handle complex operations during high traffic.

// My work included creating the core game logic, serving questions to players, validating answers, and updating scores. I also developed a “flood” mechanic to increase game difficulty after incorrect answers, adding depth to gameplay. Real-time communication was enabled through WebSockets, providing immediate feedback to players, keeping the leaderboard updated, and managing multiplayer states seamlessly. The server also handled session persistence so players could continue from where they left off even after a disconnect.

// Handling high traffic and maintaining data consistency were significant challenges. I optimized the Node.js event loop and implemented load balancing to ensure responsiveness during peak hours. For data integrity, I used SQL transactions to update scores and game states atomically, preventing inconsistencies when multiple players answered simultaneously. Security was a top priority, so I implemented JWT for secure authentication, input validation to prevent SQL injection, and encrypted WebSocket communication to prevent tampering and ensure a fair gaming environment.

// The server implementation was successful, handling high traffic and real-time interactions that kept players engaged. The architecture supported large-scale multiplayer gameplay, and the security measures safeguarded data, providing a reliable and enjoyable experience. This project was an excellent opportunity to refine my skills in server-side development, real-time communication, and security, allowing me to create a robust and secure gaming environment.
