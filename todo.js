// Discuss various techniques for optimizing the rendering performance of a React application.How would you identify performance bottlenecks, and what steps would you take to address them ?
//     State Management and Data Flow:


// Compare and contrast the Redux and MobX state management libraries in terms of their concepts, principles, and usage.When would you choose one over the other, and why ?
//     Advanced Component Patterns:


// Explain the render props pattern and provide an example of when you've used it in a React project. How does it compare to using higher-order components (HOCs) or hooks for code reuse?
// Server - Side Rendering(SSR) and Static Site Generation(SSG):


// Describe the benefits and challenges of implementing server - side rendering or static site generation in a React application.When would you choose one approach over the other, and how would you set it up ?
//     Internationalization(i18n) and Localization(l10n):


// Discuss strategies for implementing internationalization and localization in a React application.How would you handle dynamic content and language switching while ensuring good performance and SEO ?
//     Progressive Web Apps(PWAs) and Offline Support:


// Explain the concept of progressive web apps(PWAs) and the key features that make them different from traditional web applications.How would you implement offline support and caching strategies in a React PWA ?
//     Advanced Routing and Navigation:


// Dive deeper into React Router and discuss how you would handle complex routing scenarios such as nested routes, protected routes, or route transitions / animations in a React application.
// Web Accessibility(a11y):


// Describe the principles of web accessibility and how you would ensure that a React application complies with accessibility standards.Provide examples of accessible UI components and techniques for testing accessibility.
// Code Quality and Testing Automation:


// Discuss strategies for ensuring code quality and consistency in a React codebase, including code linting, code formatting, and automated testing.How would you set up continuous integration(CI) and continuous deployment(CD) pipelines for a React project ?
//     Real - time Data Synchronization:


// Explain how you would implement real - time data synchronization using WebSockets or server-sent events(SSE) in a React application.Discuss the challenges of managing real - time updates and maintaining a consistent UI state.
